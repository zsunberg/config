----Requirements:-----------------------------------------------------
Essential: (these should already be installed on a standard KDE installation)
perl                 -the script is written in perl
kdesu | kdesudo      -to gain administrative privileges
kdialog              -to show dialogs
kreadconfig          -to read kde configuration
dolphin | konqueror  -filemanager
kwrite | kate        -editor
ark                  -handles compression

Optional:
krename              -for multiple file (batch) renaming
krusader	     -to use the included krusader actions
xdg-utils            -for default application support (2.5.x-)

----Installation:-----------------------------------------------------

Some distributions have packages available in either their main repos or community repos. For easy installation and possible distro specific patches you can use them if available. Manual installation instructions below:

Version 2.3 -> 
	1. Uncompress the rootactions-servicemenu.pl script in Root_Actions_2.x to a directory in your $PATH. /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin are two valid options. Make the script executable (if it's not).

	2a. (Konqueror for KDE3) Uncompress the three .desktop files in /konqueror-KDE3 to ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus (This will enable the menu for individual users, if you wish to enable the menu for all users, copy the files to /usr/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus instead).

	2b. (Dolphin for KDE3) Uncompress the two .desktop files in /dolphin-KDE3 to ~/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus (This will enable the menu for individual users, if you wish to enable the menu for all users, copy the files to /usr/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus instead).

	2c. (Dolphin and Konqueror for KDE4) Uncompress the two .desktop files in /dolphin-KDE4 to your kde4 servicemenu folder (possibly ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus...although $KDEHOME [".kde"] can be something else in your distribution). If you wish to use konqueror instead of dolphin as your filemanager, edit 10-rootactionsfolders.desktop by changing 'dolphin' to 'konqueror'.

	2d. (Krusader for KDE4) Import krusader_rootactions.xml file in /krusader-KDE4 with krusader's action manager.

Version 2.7 ->
	GHNS installation via dolphin's servicemenu manager supported

----Available Actions----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.x
	- Open Terminal Here (folders) - open a root terminal session in chosen folder
	- Open in File Manager (folders) - open chosen folder(s) in file manager
	- Open as Text (files) - open chosen folder(s) in text editor
	- Open With ... (both) - open chosen items in a program of your choice

	- Copy (both) - copy a single file or folder (ADDED in 2.1)
	- Move/Rename (both) - if multiple items selected and a batch renamer installed (default is krename) start renamer, otherwise use a simple move/rename dialog
	- Compress (both) - Compress selected files/folders (ADDED in 2.7)
	- Delete (both) - Completely removes chosen items (as this is potentially hazardous, there is an extra confirmation dialog), handy for removing back-up files etc.

	- Ownership to Root (both) - change ownership of chosen items to root:root
	- Ownership to Active User (both) - change ownership of chosen items to current user
	- Ownership to ...  (both) - change ownership of chosen items to UID:GID of your choice

	- Change Permissions (both) - change permissions of chosen items
	If only a single folder is selected, permissions/ownership can be set recursively. If changing permissions recursively, files are only set executable if they already are executable (Otherwise all files in a directory would be set executable if the parent folder is set executable, which is necessary for the folder to be accessible)


----Translating and customizing:-----------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.x
	Edit .desktop files with a text editor to add your own language

	Edit rootactions-servicemenu.pl, the strings used in dialogs are marked with:
	"########### DIALOG MESSAGES, TRANSLATABLE STRINGS #############"
	Edit lines:
	"xx" => "Your string, xx is the country abbreviation"

	Edit .desktop files to change default applications used:

	In KDE4 and 2.5.x, the "Text editor" and "File Manager" actions should automatically use your default application for the task, you can still override using default applications by changing "defaultfm" and "defaultte" to your chosen applications in the .desktop files. 
	In KDE3 or -2.4.x, you can edit the desktop files replacing the application names with your preferred applications.

	You can also easily add your custom 'Open with [application]' entries by copying existing entries and modifying them to use your own applications.

	For "advanced" users, available configuration options can be found in the perl script under:
        "########### USER CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES #######################"
