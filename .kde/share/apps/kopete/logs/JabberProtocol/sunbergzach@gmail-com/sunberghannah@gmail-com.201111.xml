The cleaner is drying it up now and cleaning it. The plumber said it is just shower water, not sewer so that's good. i just had my laundry baskets in the laundry room so my clothes got all wet lol. it could have been worse its just kinda a pain to have to deal with though</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="3 18:34:51">yep</msg>

 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:29:44">i mean i know it happened in africa but was it really significant for america?</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:29:53">I don't really know that much about it</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:29:57">Yeah, black hawk down was real...</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:30:9">well duh, i know it was real</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:30:14">lol</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:30:17">but after that happened , we basically just said we were done and then left</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:30:57">I don't know that it really had much of an effect on making modern america</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:31:15">what about the rise of the internet</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:31:28">that had a ton to do with the making of modern america</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:31:40">it would be pretty interesting to find out more about that I think</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:32:5">I don't really know if the gulf war had a really big effect on america either</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:33:15">ya but i feel like trying to find sources for the rise of the internet would be hard and i already said i was going to do one of the other two</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:34:7">oh</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:34:8">ok</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:34:45">i don't know if i should sen him another email saying ive changed my mind again, cause ive already had to send like 3 since the soccer plans changed and stuff</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:35:7">I don't think that he'll mind if you send him another email</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:35:29">I mean its not like you're a student who's not trying</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:36:19">except that we have known about this paper or presentation for the entire semester and I am just now writing it.... i mean its only 6 pages so not too bad but still</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:36:32">what would i even search for to find out about the impact of the internet</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:36:36">?</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:37:2">like i don't really have time to not have something really concrete to research</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:37:39">yeah</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:37:41">i don't know</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:38:13">the black hawk down thing would probably be the easiest to research</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:38:38">but I don't think it really had a big impact on America</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:39:37">ok thanks</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:40:28">sorry I couldn't help more</msg>

 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:44:36">How was it for you?</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:44:52">haha nice</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:45:8">sitting and left handed is for experts only</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:45:20">well, the game was pretty bad</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:45:22">ya it was rough</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:45:34">ya that was sad</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:45:42">yeah</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:46:1">it was crazy when we scored right near the end</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:46:12">people were freaking out</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:46:18">it was like chaos</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:47:0">usually everyone pretty much keeps on standing on the bleachers, but people were jumping around and falling off</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:47:12">but then it was all for naught</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:47:22">and it was so loud</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 15:48:43">i sounded loud on the tv lol ya that one call... the helmets or unnecessary roughness... was pretty sketch. but i mean they could have made it less close earlier</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 15:49:36">yeah, the reffing definitely didn't cost us the game</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:14:14">Russia's government is pretty democratic these days right?</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:14:32">in theory</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:14:40">in practice, not so much</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:14:42">I think</msg>

 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:15:35">they are more of a Putinocracy</msg>

 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:15:42">lol</msg>

 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:16:12">but they are opposed to us on alot of things</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:16:21">and there is still alot of tension on many issues</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:16:35">their not really a close ally</msg>

 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:18:17">maybe you should  be a history teacher if you get board of aerospace... im pretty sure you could pass the praxis and that's all it takes in CO right now</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:18:56">being a history teacher would be pretty fun</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:20:6">I mean really, as I understand it, all you have to do is pass the praxis to be certified in anything right now... you could do that this summer</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:20:31">I mean I was kinda joking but you definitely could</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:20:45">yeah</msg>

 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:24:54">I think I have experienced almost all of them</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:25:6">they could take out the F word though</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:25:9">sorry about that</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:26:36">ok, actually there are a bunch that I can't relate to, but some of them are funny</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:29:56">ya some of them are really funny lol, it made me think of like homecoming or prom where i thought you had to somehow manage to be texting, going to the bathroom, or getting some of the snacks like the whole time</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:32:14">that's a pretty strong statement there - &amp;quot;don't particularly care for it&amp;quot;</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:32:16">haha</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:34:36">well i thought about it for a minute and decided that compared to other things its not so bad so i had to soften my dislike</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:34:45">ok nice</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:35:45">so did you guys raise all the money you needed for the soccer trip</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:35:46">?</msg>

 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:36:12">.</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:36:34">so i guess we'll get it after, they haven't said anything about that yet</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:36:59">nice</msg>
 <msg nick="Hannah Sunberg" in="1" from="sunberghannah@gmail.com" time="25 23:36:59">I mean the athletic department should have at least some money set aside</msg>
 <msg nick="Zachary Sunberg" in="0" from="sunbergzach@gmail.com" time="25 23:37:8">yeah</msg>
