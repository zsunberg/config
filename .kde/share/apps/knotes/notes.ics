DESCRIPTION:There are two distinct ways that the time to impact is used: 
 The predicted constant velocity time to impact (-h/hdot) is used to 
 determine which phase of descent the rotorcraft is in\, while the 
 prescribed (desired) time to impact is used to determine the descent 
 trajectory in the flare and landing phases. Since the predicted time to 
 impact determines the phase that the helicopter is in\, it indirectly has 
 a part in determining the desired trajectory\, so both of these are 
 important\, however the prescribed (desired) time to impact (determined 
 by the controller) directly determines the desired trajectory in the 
 flare and landing phases.
